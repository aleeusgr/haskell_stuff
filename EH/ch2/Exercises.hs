-- fold is a pattern of primitive recursion. Function is applied in recursive case, and the argument is what it returns in the base case.

-- foldl :: (t -> a -> t) -> t -> [a] -> t
-- foldl g t []       = t
-- foldl g t (a : as) = foldl g (g t a) as
revFoldl :: [a] -> [a]
revFoldl  = foldl (flip (:)) []  --cheating?

-- foldr f s [1, 2, 3] = f 1 . f 2 . f 3 . id $ s
--revFoldr :: [a] -> [a]


-- Implement the zipWith function with and without using list comprehensions.
-- Can you implement zipWith using foldl?

-- Try implementing concatMap using foldl and foldr. Which one is better? Why?

-- Try to work manually through calling foldl on an infinite list What happens? 
-- What does this tell you about why you canâ€™t use foldl on an infinite list?
-- Are there any other benefits to foldr when dealing with large but finite lists?
